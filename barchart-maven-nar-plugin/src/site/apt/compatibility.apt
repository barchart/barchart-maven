Compatibility

	For most of the NAR plugin we try to keep things backwards compatible. Versions 1.x were
made for Maven 1 and therefore we are not compatible with those.

	In the NAR Plugin 2.x series we had to introduce some backward incompatibilites and other changes.
Below a (rather incomplete) list.

* Version 2.1.x

	* The internal layout of the nar files (.nar extension) is stable. No changes were made.

	* The layout of the files under target and under the unpacked directory has changed. For more
information see NarLayout21 (version 2.1.x and up) and NarLayout20 (version 2.0.x).

	* The dependency in 2.0 used to be without a <type> specified. You now need to specify <type>nar</type>
as this is more in line with the standard of maven. It also allows the NAR plugin to find dependencies 
locally in a multi-module build. 

	* The main artifact is a jar file, where the NAR plugin attaches a -noarch nar file and some 
platform specific nar files. When installed and or deployed the main jar file is renamed to a nar file,
hence the dependecy type change from jar to nar. 

	* The unpacking of nar files used to take place in a subdirectory of the local repositories 
directory of that artifact. As of 2.1.x we unpack in a subdirectory of the target directory. This 
used more diskspace (and a little time), however it avoids concurrent access to possibly half unpacked
nar files when 2 or more maven invocations are running in parallel.
